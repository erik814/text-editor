# Text Editor

## Description

This is a text editor PWA.

To use this app, type your text into the field. When you click "install", the app itself will download. When you open that, your text will persist.

As with any PWA, if you go offline, the app is still useable. When your internet connection returns, the app will resync. Any changes that were made while offline will be saved.

## Tasks

For this project, I was given quite a bit of starter code, and had to connect the pieces.
